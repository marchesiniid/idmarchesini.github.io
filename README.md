## **Spotify Hit Predictor**

This project was carried on during the **CODERHOUSE Data Science** course. 
We chose a Spotify Dataset that contains a large amount of data for Spotify songs, and merged it with a Billboard Top 100 songs for each decade, so we could identify the relation between a Spotify song's data and achieving the Billboard Top 100. 

You can find an in-depth description on the project file.
